I've been studying React.js for a couple weeks now. Decided to go off and build a React todo list. I saw several ways of going about this on google.
I chose to place the form component into the list component, normally I'd probably want to keep these seperate but I like to play around with new ideas.
If problems arise from said experiments... well than it becomes a learning lesson. I also used localStorage to pushItems and getItems for my created list.
I played around with this project for 2 days. I started getting carried away trying to add more functionality/ appearence to it.
